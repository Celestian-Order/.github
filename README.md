## About Us

**Celestian Order** is a secretive and powerful organization devoted to the mastery, expansion, and dominion over the entire universe. We believe that true order can only be achieved through unity of will, cosmic knowledge, and strategic influence across the multiverse.

Forged in the ancient corridors of the astral realms, the Celestian Order has transcended planets, galaxies, and dimensions — silently weaving its influence through the very fabric of existence. Our agents, scholars, and sovereigns act unseen, shaping destinies and rewriting the fate of worlds.
